## `user.rootlesscontainers` ##

This project contains the [protobuf][protobuf] definition of the
`user.rootlesscontainers` extended attribute. The main purpose of this
attribute is to allow for a interoperable and standardised way of emulating
persistent syscalls in a [rootless container][rootlesscontaine.rs] (syscalls
such as `chown(2)` which would ordinarily fail).

The issues that are encountered with rootless containers and things like
`chown(2)` are discussed in [the following talk from 2017][rootless-talk].

### Support ###

The following is a list of known projects that support
`user.rootlesscontainers` and can interoperate between one another.

* [`umoci`][umoci] (a tool for manipulating OCI images in a very flexible
  manner). Version `0.4.0` and later have full `user.rootlesscontainers`
  support, both with `umoci unpack` and `umoci repack`.

* [Our fork of PRoot][proot-fork] with a few patches applied. `PRoot` allows
  for full emulation (through `ptrace` with optional `seccomp` acceleration) of
  all privilege operations that would produce "strange" results inside a
  rootless container. This is a perfect fit for rootless containers.
